# Deep Learning Canadian satirical news generator

This is my personal project that I have worked on that will try to generate Canadian satirical news based on Deep Learning.

## Getting Started

This project is trained using Google Colab, utilizing GPT-2 as model and The Beaverton (A Canadian Satirical news site) articles for training. See the attached Jupyter Notebook for the details.

## Example Generated 

Example #9

```
HOMECOMING: The City of Ottawa is in the process of preparing for the arrival of its long-awaited bike lanes by cutting off cars from its city streets.“I mean, we’ve waited 5 more years for the city to really make moves on creating a better, better Ottawa,” said a city councillor. “We figured we could get rid of our traffic without creating traffic. We’ll just make this a little better,” the councillor went on to describe the planned system.
But it is the pedestrian lanes that will take a long time to establish. Sources in the city’s public works department said that they are looking into the idea of an all-terrain vehicle lane instead, as a short-term solution. If it proves to be a success, it will be a one-year-only pilot experiment.

Example #189

```
Now we know exactly how much it cost to build this bridge.

The provincial government is currently mulling new environmental guidelines for Ottawa to make the most of the money they are getting to build these new expressways.
We are told these new rules will prevent government planners from making the bad choices they want to make. But they will also protect us from this kind of dangerous thinking.
Remember how Canada was really looking forward to having this bridge in 1995 and still has the most expensive public transit system in the world today.

## Improvements

This project can be easily improved with more satirical datas, such as articles from The Onion, to have its generated article to be more accurate. I have future plans to have it train with additional datas to have it improved generation.

## Showcase

I have intergrated my home server with the model above, to provide public access to this model. You can visit my homeserver here: https://jaderain.app/satire to view generated articles.

## Built With

* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) - For training with power of Google Colab
* [GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/) - Transformer based Language model that I have used for news generation
* [The Beaverton](https://www.thebeaverton.com/) - Canadian satirical news article site that host articles that my system used for training
