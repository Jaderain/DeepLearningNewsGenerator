      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "WASHINGTON D.C. — United States politician Herb Phillman has unveiled a bold new stance on the controversial issue of abortion bans by proposing exceptions in instances of rape, incest, and being a woman with whom he is having an extramarital affair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Abortion has been a stain on our nation since liberal judges forced the catastrophic decision of Roe v. Wade on us,” Phillman told reporters. “However, we believe that some very narrow exceptions are appropriate; if the woman has been raped, is a victim of incest, or has become pregnant as a result of having sex with me, personally.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The new proposal is finding tentative support from GOP leaders seeking a less-stringent alternative to abortion bans recently adopted in states such as Alabama and Georgia, which include no exceptions, even for women who wish to terminate due to the fact that they are not the wife of the married republican lawmaker who impregnated them and make him feel things he’s never felt before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As horrible as abortion is, we recognize that in some circumstances, women face the unthinkable prospect of bearing to term a pregnancy that resulted from having extra-marital sex with a lawmaker who didn’t want to put on a condom because his dick is too weirdly shaped,” a spokesperson for Phillman told reporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What if the woman will have to carry the consequences of an assault for the rest of her life? Or what if she is willing to abort a pregnancy resulting from one wild night at a Howard Johnson’s with a republican lawmaker AND she is willing to sign an NDA?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In those cases, abortion should be an option of last–or even first–resort.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While some anti-abortion groups argue that the law is too lenient, many critics are gradually coming to support the plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Initially, I was horrified to think a child would not get to be born simply because someone like Herb Phillman provided its genetic material,” anti-abortion activist Kaley Libbsom told reporters. “Then I got a closer look at his weasely little face and I thought, no child should ever be forced to carry an inheritance like that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, under the new plan the cost of abortions will not be covered due to the fact that Phillman’s wife usually goes over the credit card statement.\n",

      "CALGARY, AB – Surveying the livelihood and stability of adults born between 1982 and 2004, a report released today has concluded that the net worth of the average millennial is only 8000 likes across all on social media platforms, threatening their ability to retire happily later in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We were shocked to discover that millennial’s stockpile of personal value was so low,” stated lead author Dr. Samantha Wong-MacDonald, adding how anecdotal evidence pointed to anxiety and depression coupled with unsteady employment and large student debt may have something to do with it. “It’s raising tough questions for inter-generational insecurity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Boomers, for their part, did not have social media profiles to garner true personal worth from, so by proxy, researchers used useless, useless money. While they admit likes do give an accurate measure of an individual’s value, likes cannot, contrary to popular belief, be exchanged for goods and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report released by the Generational Research Forum looked at millennial online activity and indexed likes, retweets and hearts to give a global average of how much each respondent was actually worth in real numbers, as determined by actual people scrolling through your timelines.

      "BRAMPTON, ON — Shoppers Drug Marts across the country have begun rolling out promotions for their new “PC Opium Points Points” program — a groundbreaking initiative that offers redeemable points for every opiate prescription a customer picks up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are more opiate users than ever before, and our team has been hard at work developing strategies to ­­make safe opiate consumption a feasible reality for all Canadians,” said Carl Scott, a spokesperson for Shoppers Drugs Mart’s parent company Loblaws.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PC Opium Points program rewards customers with points that can be redeemed to subsidize the lingering costs of dispensing medications such as Vicodin, Oxycontin, Percocet, and Fentanyl. The points cannot be used towards Codeine, as the company worries the store’s younger clientele might use the discount to create cocktails known to cause grand mal seizures in people like “your 15-year-old sister’s 21-year-old guy friend” and “rapper Lil Wayne.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We want to take the opiate crisis off the streets, and evolve that into an opiate crisis in the comfort of an air-conditioned store” clarified a confident Scott.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon joining the program, your account will be preloaded with enough points to cover the entire cost of your first and second pickup, regardless of your existing health insurance status. This equitable measure means that everyone will be able to dip their toes into the opium pond— and hopefully remained hooked on visiting our exceptional pharmacists for all future needs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The program, which began its rollout in downtown Toronto stores last week, will be available nationwide in the upcoming month.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "SASKATOON – The annual meeting of Canada’s provincial and territorial premiers, The Council of the Federation, starts today and as it’s the first time since 2008 there are no women attending, the all male group is taking the opportunity to conduct these key discussions in a steamy, naked environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think we’re going to get a lot done since there aren’t any dames to bring up the gender wage gap, the country-wide shortage of quality childcare, or my lack of pants,” said one premier who for some reason didn’t want to be identified by name. “Also, they get all hysterical when I call them dames.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Each day of the conference will begin with a sausagefest breakfast before the premiers enter the men’s steam room to discuss economic growth and trade relations. Following a quick buffet lunch at a nearby strip club, the premiers will once again enter the steam room for security and immigration discussions. Dinner will be held at a different strip club, then the premiers will retire for the evening after enjoying cigars and brandy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think the all male environment will be more conducive to a successful and fruitful conference,” said another premier who also for some reason wanted to remain unnamed. “It’s not that we can’t work with women, it’s just that it’s easier to reach a consensus when everyone else in the room looks and thinks alike. The steam’s just a bonus.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look, it’s hardly our fault that there are no women here this year and that in most years there are only one or two. What do you want us to do, resign in protest en masse and shame our political parties into choosing successors that more accurately represent the demographics of our country because it’s unconscionable that half of the Canadian population is completely unrepresented at this level of government? Sure, that would fix the problem, but at what cost… to us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all of the premiers are looking forward to the men’s only atmosphere, with several expressing concern that the testosterone-heavy dialogue could devolve into a towel snapping nightmare where the smaller provinces are at the mercy of the larger ones until the premier of PEI is sacrificed to the gods in a sweaty frenzy of Lord of the Flies-type ritualistic violence. But most political experts say that outcome is unlikely, having only happened twice since the Council of the Federation was established in 2003.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they gathered in Saskatchewan, the premiers all expressed the hope that this will finally be the year the provinces and territories don’t take advantage of their absence to hold massive parties that always result in them coming home to find at least one national monument covered in puke.\n",

      "TORONTO — As rumours swirl that Rogers will opt to not renew Don Cherry’s Hockey Night In Canada contract for the 2020-21 season, interest in the job has been noted from the nation’s most obnoxious and generally all-around ignorant uncles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following 33 seasons of hosting “Coach’s Corner”, the reported departure of Don Cherry has left an opening for outspoken and boorish men, all of whom are uncles, across the country. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Yeah, I love hockey, I love telling people how they should play hockey and I DEFINITELY DON’T LIKE HOCKEY PLAYERS WITH ANY WEIRD-SOUNDING NAMES,” shouted Alan Bergeron, an uncle from Gander, Newfoundland. Like Bergeron, many similar Canadian uncles have begun flooding Rogers Sportsnet office with phonecalls and faxes, demanding that they be allowed to spew their angry and often baffling opinions live on air to the nation. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Not only will I rant about visors. I’ll go back and claim helmets and shin pads are making the league fruity,” Bergeron added, before heading outside for a dart. \n",
      "\n",
      "One particularly agitated uncle, Greg Stanhope of Airdrie, Alberta, insists that he could easily top Don Cherry’s rants. “I don’t mind telling anybody their business,” explained Stanhope, between swigs of an unidentifiable cocktail. “Whether it’s a millionaire athlete, or that time Don called most of Torontonians “left wing kooks” at Rob Ford’s swearing in – I’ll always shoot my mouth off in a way that’d make Grapes proud.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just ask my family why they don’t invite me to Thanksgiving no More,” Stanhope noted, while adjusting his faded “Helix World Tour ‘84” t-shirt. .\n",
      "\n",
      "While Don Cherry’s firing remains a rumour, and has not been confirmed by Sportsnet, the network has reportedly received thousands of audition tapes, illegible handwritten letters, and several aggressively colourful fabric swatches from uncles across the nation – all of whom believe they could fill Don Cherry’s outlandish blazers. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I personally think I gots both the volume, and the ability to yell at length about topics I gots no expertise in,” bellowed Sudbury uncle Trevor Livingston. “Plus, if hired, I promise to find an entirely new type of European to rant about every single week.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you better believe I’d look good in a neon flamingo pink jacket telling Ron MacLean to shut his yuppie mouth,” insisted Moose Jaw uncle Ken Kennings, in his nicotine-stained application letter. “Plus, I got several concussions myself, so I’d be happy to advocate for the league to drop all them namby-pamby rules they got against fighting. Also, where am I,” Kennings added, before asking to go “sleep one off” on his nephew’s bed “for a spell”.\n",

      "The story from the beginning started with John McConville\n",
      "\n",
      "CHARLOTTE – John McConville was born in 1874, when his grandfather made up the story about how he fell down a well and hit something on his head. But he wasn't going to tell a story. Besides, just the thought of it upset him so much that he knew better, that in the very next moment he'd have to tell that story.\n",
      "He made his home for about seven years, for a time there were still houses left of the same shade he was born in. Then, McConville, was finally adopted by a family in which he knew very well what they were like, in which he could tell his own story about the world and what they were like, and where to find a fish. But how would he tell it? \n",
      "It's all the same to him, he kept telling himself, 'That one guy who knew me so well would tell it. \n",
      "At first he didn't seem to understand what was going on, so he did what parents across the country are supposed to do. They started telling kids about how different the land was in the 1940s. Then McConville told the story to his adopted grandfather about how it was when people were free to wander or he wandered and a soldier was there to catch him, and the soldiers did the rest. He could tell anyone from the 1950s on how a fighter pilot who never talked looked like the guy his grandfather told about from the 1940s. He loved everything about them not only for their freedom, but for their story.  It took him a few years to find it again.  And then he started telling it to everyone whom he could tell, and he could tell them too exactly how.  They would tell about how bad the guy in the movie was, that he hit his head against the moon when he thought it was going to go away.    He would tell them about the time that he was a child with a bunch of ghosts that were supposed to scare him away from a place that was haunted by some of the men who used to love him.\n",
      "What you didn't hear out, in fact, was how his childhood changed after he moved to a new city. Things changed. He didn't remember being born in 1880, and instead always thought that his grandfather told him in the beginning. After seeing how much he'd changed, he thought that his grandfather had kept secrets. When he wasn't sure, he told everyone. But when he looked at the picture of him with his brother, that he used to share all the time, it made him think that he was just a little kid.\n",
      "One day he looked around at the place, in the old barn, was the old man that he used to go to. He thought, if it's all true, then it would be worth saving for when he was grown up.  He had nothing to lose, so why take it. He remembered standing outside the barn when he heard the train track passing his window. He couldn't remember why he started to think that way, but he remembered when he was little.  It seemed like something must have happened to him, and then he wanted to remember it all. As it was late, John would be up from his bed every evening to go to the barn himself, and when he was up he couldn't help but remember it, because then he couldn't stop thinking about it. At first he told everyone he did, but soon he would tell them everything on his own. He would explain everything, make it sound like it was all told by him and the people in the barn, and tell people that he still loved them so much.  He told people he was going to be the kind of boy he always wanted to be, and he always thought he could be better, and he would always want to protect them so much.  But when people started realizing he was telling everything, they stopped telling, and now they always tell, only to stop when they've seen enough of his story to figure out what it was.\n",
      "It is now well past 2 in the afternoon, when he finally decides that not all of it must have been told, and he is about to start telling the story of how he once heard a man make his brother cry over how he couldn't leave\n",

      "“What I did know though is that I was not afraid of him. If he asked me about my father, I would only answer in a vague way, because I would never know who my father was. That way, if anyone asked me, I could never tell them anything.”\n",
      "After one year of this approach to relationships, Elliot thought he knew people who could help him, but it soon became clear that “it was mostly just a bunch of people who were the kind of people he wanted to befriends with.”\n",
      "Elliot admitted that he wasn’t exactly convinced that he could keep trying to convince people to get more involved in their relationships, but with so many ways for others to get involved, he found it easier to accept that he would have to let go.\n",
      "“People tend to forget how close they really are. I’m sure the guys who came to my parents with my two year old son a few months ago all wanted the same thing in life. They wanted to have a long term relationship, but they knew deep down that what they had was basically a family’, Elliot said. “I don’t think that’s fair to the family though, and I was afraid that it would have to end. I mean I’ve always been the first guy to tell them that I didn’t want kids – until they told me a bunch of bullshit when the subject was suddenly one of the things they wanted to discuss. I then had to explain to them that when they get older (I’m pretty sure they will), we can just continue with that, but it won’t work. They knew that I wasn’t doing them any favors.”\n",
      "Elliot also told reporters that he had to try something else to try and keep the relationship going.\n",
      "“I mean I have to admit, my friends and I were worried that we probably weren’t doing as good a job of keeping the relationship going, because I didn’t tell them, and not telling them was the only way to do it.”\n",
      "In the beginning few months, Elliot said how the relationship had started out very positive between him and his parents, but then the situation changed. His parents started telling their friends that they thought that there was no way that they would ever have children, and would definitely never stop dating each other, which they had a lot of trouble understanding. Elliot also expressed that he didn’t want to hear about his parents because of another huge worry – he said that he thought that his parents are horrible parents because they are completely oblivious to the fact that they made him their son.\n",
      "Elliot also confessed that his mom wouldn’t invite him in the house to be with his parents just to be friends, and his father would talk to Elliot, but not interact with him.\n",
      "As soon as Elliot started getting in trouble, he took to saying that his parents were a lot better at caring for others than he was, and asking his father why he didn’t tell him.\n",
      "After another three and a half years, Elliot realized that he had to finally get over his fear of commitment, and that he would have to stop saying all of these horrible things to his family to just communicate with them.\n",
      "In an effort to break the cycle, Mr. and Mrs. Elliot brought their son into the house with them one day, and invited him to hang out with his friends. After a while, the whole family started thinking that it was probably best for everyone if Elliot would spend more time with them, but instead he quickly got into a real fight with Mr. and Mrs. Elliot, who started telling him to go get away from them. After a long amount of time trying to get Elliot to stop the fighting, they finally gave him a choice. He could either go, or have some time alone with his family, and tell them that he was sorry, and that he was a total shitty parent, and that he would never treat his kids badly ever again.\n",
      "“I think that, really, this is a good thing. Elliot should have spent more time with his family, but there is no way he’s going to stop telling them exactly what he thinks about them, and that he doesn’t want them to have kids. It’s almost like Elliot just wants to help other people.”\n",
      "At this point, Mr. and Mrs. Elliot asked Elliot to go to a different family, but he immediately told them that he was too tired to tell his parents.\n",
      "Elliot finally realized that his father was probably too sick to tell him the truth and that he wasn’t going to go to the hospital just to come home.\n",
      "“It’s easy to forget that everything he told them about how he didn’t want to have kids was the exact same things I told him when\n",

      "Posted by L-E-A-R at 9:30 PM<|endoftext|>After seven years at the helm, Jock St-Louis has moved on to a full-time career with ESPN. In a move seen as more a sign of growing maturity for Canada than a direct indictment of his employer, St-Louis, 61, the sportswriter has announced he'll have to get an education and graduate before moving up as co-host of SportsCentre, as well as doing some internships and starting a personal website.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm grateful to have a good deal of time and an excellent network to create compelling and relatable content with\" said St-Louis, who also serves as SportsCentre host. \" I know for sure those programs don't pay, but I'll enjoy every second of it. There's nothing more exciting, I always go to work hard and get promoted up on the network.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The outgoing sports journalist was hired by ESPN in 1994 after being the sports editor for CBC Canada. However, the network had previously fired St-Louis amid a dispute over an article he wrote in November 2003 about the rise of the NFL as the world's number and not the country's number one team. However, he now appears to be moving on to something completely different.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This makes me feel more at home. I feel I've moved on to more important things than being interviewed on SportsCentre or making the news,\" said St-Louis. \"I also felt like there wasn't a place for me in a network that seems to always be talking about 'celebrities, sports, and what a cool, stylish thing they are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While his contract is up at the end of this year, ESPN CEO John Skipper remains bullish on St-Louis as an asset at the network – and it appears as though there might be more of the latter in the near future. In a new interview, the current host admitted to never wanting to change, and as much as he may want a new job, he already has one to go on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've never really given a lot of thought to work – whether it being at a startup, or something else. I never really had any other life options, and when I heard ESPN wanted me to head up their show in 2016, that was definitely the next best thing.\"\n",

      "On the morning of December 3, the entire organization has made it a priority to wear its fur to work by wearing a head-to-toe black & white t-shirt, which is easily identified as a fang-fester by the faint outline of a human's fang and the distinctive white, canine teeth that it leaves behind it on the ground.\n",
      "At an official press conference, the organization was applauded for showing this simple gesture of community in such a drastic fashion.\n",
      "On that day, the group had no concern for the fur-eater to get back at them by using it as a weapon, as a vehicle, or for anyone to know that it actually is a human-eater.\n",

That’s when I looked into the computer books and realized that I didn’t have all of Europe on my flight. I got out my passport and called home to ask if a coach was running.

      "\n",
      "TORONTO – After years of stalling on making strides towards equality, the TTC will come out with a pay equity policy soon.\n",
      "“As of the beginning of next year, we’ll be going back to the drawers in our budget to decide what’s fair for everyone.” said TTC Chair Karen Stintz after unveiling three new equity provisions: “We’d like it when they pay more just to ride the subway.”\n",
      "Stintz explained that after the TTC was forced to adopt pay equity policies in order to make subway fare increases possible in 2012, they were compelled to go back and rework their policy to keep their customers happy. \n",
      "“We had the opportunity to take a step back, look at what happened and figure out a new path forward,” said Stintz, “so I’m now calling on Toronto citizens to help me fund a transition plan that will allow me to spend my savings on a subway.”\n",
      "Other transit commissioners are equally excited about the changes, including Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong, who introduced the legislation just over a year ago, and Councillor Denzil ‘Roth’ Ford, who was among those who took to asking for people to buy tickets to the St. Patrick’“s Day parade on the TTC’s website last year.\n",
      "“You didn’t tell me this, but I’m so happy with it.” said Minnan-Wong as he pulled up to a city bus stop in Scarborough to get a ride home.\n",
      "Minnan-Wong, like many in Toronto, also expressed relief at the TTC’s decision to make a pay equity policy happen for all employees. \n",
      "“Just for myself, it was just so gratifying to see the money that I’m used to making just go into a fund to support people who can’t afford any other recourse,” said Minnan-Wong in between giggles. “Honestly, I mean I get where the money is coming from from here.”\n",
      "In the words of TTC employees “We were so nervous, we couldn’t even tell you we couldn’t do it!”, TTC employees are particularly grateful to have not lost the ability to make profit on their trips due to other passengers wanting to take the money home for their families. \n",

      "“I’m not going to apologize for helping them,” Ford added.\n",
      "“The CBC should be ashamed of themselves,” Ford said before the Sun story on him and the Sun’s reporters aired that afternoon. “I’ve never met a CBC journalist I didn’t like.”\n",
      "At press time, Mayor Ford had also reached out to City Hall for a long term deal so that they could keep their press conferences out of my mouth, and a deal with the federal government to not use Toronto’s water sources.\n",

      "“We just wanted to take in the atmosphere as we sat down. And I even thought that if we did we would stop talking about politics and start talking about science. But we couldn’t help ourselves,” said senior researcher Dr. J. Scott Fazenda, who had brought the laptops to work. “It was definitely like a one-time thing.” \n",
      "With the conference over and everyone had gone home, researchers at the Centre for Cybersecurity have been brainstorming about what to do now that Cybersecurity’s got the cyber police. \n",
      "“It’s interesting that while it did seem that the conference was pretty chill, it felt like the police really were going after the conference participants or something: all of them were a bunch of luddites who were doing nothing to stop the conference; and also the fact that the speakers included all the security researchers on earth who would be doing nothing to stop the conference,” explained Dr. J. Scott Fazenda. “But the police were really pushing us towards doing some kind of action.” He added that he didn’t know whether that ”action” would involve any arrests. \n",
      "According to experts, the incident has made Cybersecurity feel more than they thought they would. \n",
      "“Oh my God, what are these people up to today?!?! I feel like I’m getting into an argument about these guys every time. All of you, please let them speak!” cried a security expert at the conference. \n",

      "“That’s why I’m so fascinated by ‘I Was The Man After All’,” said Catherine, a twenty-two-year old porn star whose videos are often filmed on her boyfriend’s phone. “She looks so pretty just in this little thumbnail. I would go the entire week if I could only keep staring at her as I watch this. And now I have to wait and watch as she is taken to a new, and better, and … and … fuck!”\n",
      "The couple has started the month by watching a thousand hours of other people’s ex-girlfriends, and have been playing it out over and over again by watching their friends and family do the same.\n",
      "“It’s a long, hard slog to keep me from thinking that I’m a guy who goes at these kind of things, just because I’m here with you to help us get away with it,” said Catherine. “I’m just glad that you made me look like I actually know what I’m doing.”\n",
      "“But I’m glad that our conversations have been limited mainly to how much you liked my sex tape,” said Catherine, smiling. “So I’m hoping that you will finally understand what a pussy is, and have a lot more fun with it by taking my clothes off.”\n",

      "The school district has now launched a Twitter campaign to encourage parents to do the same at their children’s school today to prevent the future social media celebrity from falling prey to the “poverty, addiction, physical abuse, sexual harassment” he would inevitably suffer from, not to mention the “mental illness”.\n",
      "“When parents can be so confident in their kids, we give ourselves the opportunity to act like shit kids,” said Principal Michelle Riehn to the class of sixth-graders. “And you guys’d feel bad for making a little girl feel small, so tell the children this.”\n",

      "“There’s literally nothing to do at home right this moment and they don’t even want to know,” said Dr. Hall.\n",
      "“And the only thing that comes in their house will be the morning paper at 6 am anyway so they’re not even bothering.”\n",
      "The study also found that men and women were equally likely to take their own cars to work, drive to the airport, or eat breakfast at the office, all the while wondering why all the women were going around driving to those restaurants in the first place.\n",
      "“I’m so tired right now,” said resident Mary Healey. “I just hope I get home and have a wonderful day.”\n",
      "Dr. Hall added that the overwhelming majority of women she questioned were completely unable to get home from work quickly enough to get a quick shower; and that they were less likely to go to work as they were in the middle of a long weekend.\n",
      "“I’m a single mother of four, so I get it,” said Dr. Healey. “I also remember back when I was pregnant I took a two day road trip to Europe, with one of my kids, and was pretty disappointed. Luckily we were able to make the trip in two separate cars, and now if we can’t get there for a quick shower we’ll just eat junk food in the parking lot until all the calories run out.”\n",

      "OTTAWA – In a move that will force the province of Newfoundland and Labrador to cease its activities and cease all international travel, the federal government has granted Newfoundland and Labrador the power to act as an immigration detention facility if it chooses, forcing the province to surrender the province to federal law enforcement officers under the Constituted by the federal government.\n",
      "“This is a first in that the Newfoundland and Labrador legislature was not invited to legislate a law or to recognize a treaty that would be invalidated under the Constituted by the federal government,” said Minister of Immigration Sarah Hoffman.\n",
      "Faced with the prospect of a federal law of their design, the legislature was not able to provide any legal advice, and this prompted the federal government to issue a draft law without legal support that allowed for the province to act, and take the law into their own hands.\n",
      "“They thought this would be a pleasant little surprise for all our newcomers, but it just got more nefarious,” said a visitor, who was also in possession of the drafted law. “It contained provisions that would allow the government to detain or otherwise hold up to 3,000 immigrants for deportation, without recourse to the courts, until the situation changes.”\n",
      "When asked how this law will affect their local businesses, businesses in the province would not comment so as to not provide any valuable information about the new law in the future.\n",

In addition to finding that those at the bottom are having a really good time, I have also come up with two wonderful solutions to the worldwide poverty crisis. One, and this is really the biggest, is the universal provision of free health care. How wonderful to see an economic policy that allows these poor people the freedom to use taxpayer money to buy health care that is free.\n",
      "“And maybe the best thing about this study is that we’ve solved the very real problem of the poor–the social exclusion of those who do.”\n",
      "The researchers used data from the United Nations’s World Development Report to find that the world’s poor are actually much happier now than they were at a hundred years ago.\n",
      "“The study found that the poor have improved significantly since the 1960s,” said Dr. Andrew Aydin. “The world is healthier and better off in all ways. There was a time when the poor were suffering from poverty and discrimination and were forced into destitution; the rise of the Soviet Union was bad enough, but the rich can now afford luxury vacations, but the poor can’t? The world is better off than it was in some ways.”\n",
      "Dr. Andrew Aydin hopes to see the report used as a way for governments to give their citizens a voice and better treatment instead of the status quo. This could also lead to the eradication of poverty as a global crisis, just as with all other social ills.\n",

      "We're not entirely sure how to put this, but here it goes:\n",
      "It's a very sad day in Canadian journalism with the CBC. While it's sad to see the corporation go out of business the second it closed their doors, we find that in the wake of its closure, the CBC is no longer a vital voice for Canadians in this country–in fact, it's lost that voice.

      "Not wanting the CBC to die, Johnston has already done what any billionaire would do when facing a hostile takeover from the owners of another corporation: he made a lot of money from his ownership of the CBC.\n",
      "I would like all the news outlets in the CBC family to take note of this, and ask all the same questions: does the CBC ever support any of the views expressed here, in our comments section? Does the CBC have any policies that prevent it from acting on the views and statements expressed by it? We don't know. All we know is that Johnston will keep profiting from the CBC if it gets in his way.\n",

Upon searching Haskins personal effects and the residence, they found marijuana plants and a baggie of cocaine. The bags were seized, but Haskins has yet to be charged.\n",
      "In custody, Haskins admitted to an additional marijuana charge after he admitted to being the first to make a bust in connection with possession of over the limit paraphernalia. He was also arrested for possessing cannabis oils with the intent to distribute them for the purpose of trafficking. At that same time according to the RCMP, he admitted to possessing over the limit paraphernalia with the intent to sell.\n",
      "A witness to the arrest says Haskins was then transported to a local hospital where a doctor found he had a drug overdose. During questioning, he reportedly admitted to having a lot of marijuana that he wasn't supposed to have when he first arrived in Victoria.\n",
      "At this time, Haskins is believed to be suffering from an overdose of a variety of prescription drugs, including hydrocodone, hydromorphone.\n",

      "While the world continues to learn about the many benefits of increased productivity and increased leisure time, commuters across the GTA are starting to get tired of spending their off-time on work related pursuits such as work, family, or kids.\n",
      "You can blame the recession. Or you can blame the TTC. Or you can blame that woman at the next bus stop. And maybe she shouldn't blame you. Either way, she is not paying you to be an employee at all.\n",
      "However the TTC has learned that most of the times they can't pay any amount of money. In its desperation to keep up with the demand it has resorted to the tactic of giving passengers a coupon code that allows them to ride a shuttle to work or a coupon that lets them earn a little more time to be the best they can be. But it is all a bit of a scam.\n",
      "Some people say you shouldn't take advantage of people in this way. And in the short time I had the subway this morning, I saw people all over the city who were so tired.\n",
      "And even though I was paying for everything in this city and that included taking the bus to work in the summertime, they were still going to be paying me more than what they should. They were going to keep picking up the garbage and parking the car and still they were going to pay me more than some people can make in a month right in this country. Or anywhere else in this country. So that's the problem. The TTC must realize how dangerous and exploitative this scheme will be.\n",
      "They can even make a small concession in terms of the TTC is now hiring staff at hourly rates much lower than what customers pay for.\n",

      "The bill will allow the Government to set regulations for the growing, manufacturing and distribution of medical marijuana and cannabis. It also will give the Government the right to regulate the sale of high and low THC forms of marijuana, and the right to sell recreational marijuana. The bill also allows the Government to ban pot shops within 30 km of a school or school zone.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the 1970s, one man decided to create a scheme that would make him feel the most secure. He called this system, 'I Don't Need the Money'.\n",
      " And I Don​’t Need the Money\n",
      "First, he would lie to people about who he was and what he did to get rich so they would believe they were living in a world of the future. The scam would involve using his fake name and the names of the people who would really be selling your stuff.\n",
      "He made a special offer to anyone who would work for him – a very high fee. If you agreed to work without pay, they kept a record on which of your real names you used. They could then use this to threaten you if they ever found out you worked for them without pay.  The promise of money was really what got the people he worked with to buy in.\n",
      "So the truth is, the first person to come up with the idea to use the name of your ex-girlfriend on a dating site, and then lie about what it's like to be rich, the person who created this scheme would be rewarded millions.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what’s more important? You know, the money, the reputation for lies, or the trust and safety of your friends?\n",

The second man invented and sold his own products, including the name for all of his other products, the name he used to deceive as many people as he sold to. His name was “Jingle.  ” He was convicted and imprisoned in the UK.\n",
      "But the man behind this whole scam?\n",
      "The woman who created the fake name he used on the dating site was “O.C.” The O.C. is the one, the only one. This is why he’s out of prison. He lied his way through life to create the O.C. name to further his scam. If anyone was going to be rich, it’ll be them.\n",
      "But you won’t believe what he did to get rich. He hired thousands of people from the FBI, Mossad, CIA, and the KGB to look into your fake name. He even hired some people from “Criminal”, the FBI, police, and the KGB. He even hired a spy to look into your Facebook account. Now how can you trust these people? They didn’t even look at his name.\n",
      "Well, maybe if we talk about him now. Maybe we don’t. Maybe he’ll be in prison soon, or some judge’s will find out about this.\n",
